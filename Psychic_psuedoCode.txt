## Option One: Psychic Game (Basic)

![Psychic](Images/1-Psychic.jpg)

1. [Watch the demo](psychic-game-demo.mov).

2. You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

3. Guess what letter I'm thinking of

4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

Title: Do you have what it takes to be a Jedi Mind Reader? #thepsychicgame
HTML: Display instructions. 
	Can you guess the letter I'm thinking of?
	To start playing, simply enter a letter for your guess. 
	There will be a total of 5 rounds. 	
	Each round you will have 10 guesses.
	Happy guessing! May the force be with you. 
	
	WINNER Ranking: 
			5/5: You are the chosen one.  
			4/5: Silver Surfing Jedi.	  
			3/5: You are not a Jedi yet. 
	LOSER Ranking: 
			0/5: There is no hope
			1/5: There is another 
			2/5: Don't give into the dark side. 
	TIE Ranking: 
					
Outline: 
1. List variables, lower case letters a - z
	var computerChoices = ["a", ... , "z"];

2. Create a function to loop for 10 cycles. 
	for (var i = 0; i!== computerChoices.lengthl; i++){

	}

3. Create a function to loop the loop for 10 cycles 5 times 	
4. Determine the results based on the 5 rounds
5. Display the ranking. 


1)  - the user types different letters on the keyboard to

2) Display screen (browser)
	 - display the following: 
		WINS: # of correctly guessed letters
			- If the player wins increase the wins counter and restart game
			- If the player wins more than 5 times - YOU ARE A PSYCHIC! Do you want to continue 				your training?
		LOSSES: # of incorrectly guessed letters
			- If the player loses increase the losses counter and restart game
			- If the player loses more than 5 times - GAME OVER
		Guesses Left: # of guesses left
			 - this should update
		Your guesses so far: specific letters that the user types should display until the user WINS 					or loses the round. 



		var computerChoices = ["a", ... "z"];

		document.onkeyup = function(event) {
		var userChoices = String.fromCharCode(event.keyCode).toLowerCase();
			if ((userChoices ==="a") || ... ||(userChoices ==="z")) {
				if ((userChoices !== computerChoices)){
				losses++;		
				}
				else if ((userChoices === computerChoices)){
				wins++;
				}
			}
		}
		 
		
		Create for loop cycle 10 times -
		pickNumber: function() {
			alert("Previous Letter Selection: " + this.computerChoices);
			this.computerChoices = {user .onkeyup value};
		},
